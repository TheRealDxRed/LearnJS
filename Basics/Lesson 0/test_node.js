// We can print messages to the console like this:
console.log("Hello World!");
// Unlike in C and C++, we don't have to send '\n' or endl with our
// string because console.log does it for us.

// We can also store our output as a variable like this...
var greeting = "Hello World!";
// ...and then print it out using console.log again
console.log(greeting);
